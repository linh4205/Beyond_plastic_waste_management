# Beyond plastic waste management

It is evident that climate change is urgent in our lives more than ever. With that plastic waste is a critical issue that needs to get propper awareness so that we can secure the future of our planet and make the world more sustainable. Despite being made from natural materials like cellulose, coal and crude oil through polymerization processes, plastic is non-biogradable, leading to massive landfill shortages and pollution. Moreover plastic trash harms it's environment as it accumulates there, leaving toxic chemicals, representing a threat not only for us but also for other ecosystems. As plastic production, hence also plastic waste production, has increased exponentially in the last decades the challenge for us of managing it propperly has risen as well due to the limited ressources and space our planet offers. Raising awareness about this waste has the potential to influence consumer habits and pressure industries to adopt eco-friendly alternatives that have the potential to stem this problem.

The project aims to analyze how plastic waste management varies in differnt regions of the world and what factors possibly affect these tendencies. With that we are enabled to get directions for possible solution approaches and take a look beyond plastic waste management.
